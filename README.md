## Introduction
The Iris flower dataset is a well-known dataset in the machine learning community, containing 150 samples with 4 features: Sepal Length, Sepal Width, Petal Length, and Petal Width. The goal of this project is to build a classification model to predict the species of Iris flowers.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Iris flower dataset, which is available in the `Iris.csv` file. It contains the following columns:
- Id
- SepalLengthCm
- SepalWidthCm
- PetalLengthCm
- PetalWidthCm
- Species

## Installation
To run this project, you need to have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed. You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash```
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn

##Usage
Clone this repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/iris-flower-classification.git
cd iris-flower-classification


Open the Jupyter Notebook:
jupyter notebook Iris_Flower_Classification.ipynb
Follow the instructions in the notebook to upload the dataset, visualize data, train models, and make predictions.

##Models
The project implements the following machine learning models for classification:

Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Logistic Regression
Decision Tree
Each model is trained and evaluated on the Iris dataset. The notebook provides code for training, testing, and evaluating the models.

##Results
The models are evaluated based on accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report. Here are the accuracy scores for each model:

SVM: 96.67%
Logistic Regression: 96.67%
Decision Tree: 93.33%
